# Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns

This is my repository for Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns Project for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

In this project, we will build our first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. Some of the codes are provided, but the implementation of the neural network is left for us to complete.

You can find Udacity's original repository [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-bikesharing)
